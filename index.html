            <h2>A brief summary of Dr. Rajendra Prasad</h2>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>
                Dr. Rajendra Prasad was born in a Kayastha family in Ziradei, in the Siwan district of Bihar during the
                British Raj. His father, Mahadev Sahai Srivastava, was a scholar of both Sanskrit and Persian
                languages. His mother, Kamleshwari Devi, was a devout woman who would tell stories from the Ramayana and
                Mahabharata to her son. He was the youngest child and had one elder brother and three elder sisters. His
                mother died when he was a child, and his elder sister then took care of him.
            </p>
            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>
                After the completion of traditional elementary education, he was sent to the Chapra District School.
                Meanwhile, in June 1896, at the early age of 12, he was married to Rajavanshi Devi. He, along with his
                elder brother, Mahendra Prasad, then went to study at T.K. Ghosh's Academy in Patna for a period of two
                years. He secured first in the entrance examination to the University of Calcutta and was awarded Rs. 30
                per month as a scholarship.

                Prasad joined the Presidency College, Calcutta in 1902, initially as a science student. He passed the F.
                A. under the University of Calcutta in March 1904 and then graduated with a first division from there in
                March 1905. Impressed by his intellect, an examiner once commented on his answer sheet that the
                "examinee is better than examiner". Later he decided to focus on the study of arts and did his M.A.
                in Economics with a first division from the University of Calcutta in December 1907. There he lived with
                his brother in the Eden Hindu Hostel. A devoted student as well as a public activist, he was an active
                member of The Dawn Society. It was due to his sense of duty towards his family and education that he
                refused to join Servants of India Society, as it was during that time when his mother had died as well
                as his sister became a widow at the age of nineteen and had to return to her parents' home. Prasad was
                instrumental in the formation of the Bihari Students Conference in 1906 in the hall of Patna College. It
                was the first organisation of its kind in India and produced important leaders from Bihar like
                Anugrah Narayan Sinha and Krishna Singh who played a prominent role in the Champaran Movement and
                Non-cooperation Movement.
